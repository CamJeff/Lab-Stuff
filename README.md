# Physics Labs

This repository shows all the materias used to complete each of the labs taken in my physics "Measurements Laboratory" course. The core hardware of this class is the Arduino Uno, a micro-controller that enables a computer to send digital and analog output signals to control various experimental devices and accept digital/analog inputs. Each of folders has all necessary python/arduino code used to complete each lab. The lab manual, and the final lab reports, are shown below:
